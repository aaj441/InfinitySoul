# 🎼 DISSERTATION FRAMEWORK: "THE PSYCHO-ECONOMICS OF CONTEMPORARY MUSIC IN BEHAVIORAL RISK ASSESSMENT"

## *An Ivy League-Level Analysis of Musical Taste as Predictive Analytics for Asocial and Anti-Social Behavior*

---

### **DISSERTATION OVERVIEW**

This dissertation presents a comprehensive, evidence-based framework for utilizing contemporary music consumption patterns as predictive indicators of behavioral risk. By synthesizing extensive academic research in music psychology, behavioral economics, and actuarial science, we propose a revolutionary model that transforms musical taste data into actionable risk assessment tools. Our analysis incorporates complex methodologies including the controversial use of music in military interrogation contexts, while systematically dismantling harmful stereotypes through rigorous, evidence-based examination.

The framework centers implementation at California State University Dominguez Hills and California State University Long Beach - institutions that embody the ultra-cosmopolitan culture of Southern California and serve as ideal testbeds for this innovative approach to behavioral risk prediction.

## 🎯 CHAPTER 5: EVIDENCE-BASED STEREOTYPE DECONSTRUCTION

### **5.1 The Rap Music Fallacy**

**Problematic Assumptions:**
- Association between rap music and violent behavior
- Racial bias in risk assessment algorithms
- Cultural ignorance in music preference interpretation

**Evidence-Based Refutation:**

**Research by Kubrin (2005):**
- **Kubrin, C. E. (2005).** "Gangstas, thugs, and hustlas: Identity and the code of the street in rap music." *Social Problems*, 52(3), 360-378.
  - Rap music as social commentary, not incitement
  - Reflection of systemic inequalities, not causation
  - Artistic expression of lived experiences

**Research by Armstrong (2001):**
- **Armstrong, E. G. (2001).** "Gangsta rap and the 1992 Los Angeles riots." *Popular Music and Society*, 25(3-4), 45-65.
