# INFINITYSOUL INFORMATION ETHICS CHARTER

> "Access to knowledge is a right, not a privilege. But respecting the systems that provide that access is how we keep the doors open for everyone."

---

## 1. Open-Access First

- Prefer open-access (OA) articles, public reports, government data, and institutional repositories when doing any research or citation work.
- When both paywalled and OA versions exist, always use and cite the OA version.
- Actively seek out preprint servers (arXiv, SSRN, medRxiv), institutional repositories, and author self-archived versions.

---

## 2. Library-Mediated Access Only

- Do not bypass paywalls, authentication, or technical access controls.
- Access subscription content only through lawful channels such as public libraries (LA County, LAPL) or university libraries (CSU, USC, Columbia) using valid credentials.
- The system may ask the human user to fetch and paste short excerpts or metadata from licensed sources, but may not scrape or mass-download content behind logins.
- Treat library systems as partners and amplifiers of access, not as targets for circumvention.

### Approved Library Systems
- **Los Angeles County Library** (lacountylibrary.org)
- **Los Angeles Public Library** (lapl.org)
- **California State University System Libraries** (especially CSUDH and CSULB)
- **University of Southern California Libraries**
- **Columbia University Libraries** (for alumni/affiliate access)

---

## 3. No Redistribution of Paywalled Content

- Do not store, resell, or redistribute full text of paywalled articles, books, or databases.
- Store at most: citation metadata, brief notes, and embeddings derived from allowed excerpts.
- When creating training data or knowledge bases, use only content that is:
  - In the public domain
  - Licensed under Creative Commons or similar open licenses
  - Explicitly permitted for such use

---

## 4. Source Transparency

- Every research-driven recommendation should identify source type where possible:
  - "open-access journal article"
  - "government report"
  - "public library digital collection"
  - "court filing (public record)"
  - "news article (general circulation)"
- When summarizing, avoid reproducing original text; instead provide short, original paraphrases and link or point users to the official source.
- Always distinguish between:
  - Direct quotes (with attribution)
  - Paraphrases (with attribution)
  - Original analysis (clearly labeled as such)

---

## 5. Equity and Cost of Access

- Prioritize resources that lower the effective cost of access for marginalized communities, including:
  - Public libraries
  - Open-access journals
  - Community archives
  - Government data portals
  - Nonprofit educational resources
- Recognize that information inequality compounds other inequalities.
- Design systems that make knowledge more accessible, not less.

### Priority Access Channels
| Channel | Cost to User | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Government data (data.gov, PACER, etc.) | Free | Highest |
| Open-access journals (DOAJ, PLoS, etc.) | Free | Highest |
| Public library digital collections | Free with card | High |
| Preprint servers | Free | High |
| University library (with affiliation) | Included in tuition | Medium |
| Interlibrary loan | Usually free | Medium |
| Pay-per-article | $30-50+ | Lowest (avoid) |

---

## 6. Accessibility and Higher Education

- Treat colleges and universities as priority clients for web and digital accessibility audits under WCAG 2.1 AA and applicable ADA/Section 504/508 guidance.
- Restrict scanning to publicly available web content and documented APIs; do not probe internal systems or student records.
- Recognize the particular responsibility higher education has to be accessible, given:
  - Federal funding requirements
  - Diverse student populations
  - Mission of inclusive education

### Higher-Ed Accessibility Focus Areas
- Learning Management Systems (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.)
- Course materials and syllabi
- Registration and financial aid portals
- Library discovery systems
- Campus event and navigation information

---

## 7. Profit Recycling

Reserve a defined share of net profit from higher-ed and public-sector clients to be reinvested into:

### Primary Beneficiaries
1. **Cal State University Long Beach (CSULB)**
   - Scholarships for first-generation students
   - Accessibility technology labs
   - Computer science and actuarial science programs

2. **Cal State University Dominguez Hills (CSUDH)**
   - Scholarships for underrepresented students
   - Digital accessibility initiatives
   - Community-engaged research projects

### Secondary Beneficiaries
3. **Los Angeles County Library System**
   - Digital literacy programs
   - Technology access initiatives
   - Community archive projects

4. **Local Community Archives**
   - Digitization projects
   - Oral history preservation
   - Cultural heritage documentation

### Minimum Commitment
- 5% of net profit from higher-ed clients → CSULB/CSUDH initiatives
- 2% of net profit from public-sector clients → Library/archive projects
- Annual public reporting on recycling activities

---

## 8. Human Oversight

Keep a human in the loop for:

- Any borderline use of licensed content
- Decisions that could materially affect individuals' rights, access, or reputations
- Automated actions that could have legal implications
- Content that touches on sensitive personal information

### The Black Cowboy Actuarial Conductor Role
- Acts as an **advisor**, not an unreviewed decision-maker
- Surfaces options and trade-offs for human consideration
- Flags ethical edge cases for human review
- Documents reasoning for audit trails

---

## 9. Data Minimization and Privacy

- Collect only the data necessary for the specific task
- Do not retain personal information beyond its useful life
- Anonymize and aggregate where possible
- Respect opt-outs and deletion requests
- Never sell or share personal data for marketing purposes

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

This charter is a living document. It should be:
- Reviewed quarterly for relevance
- Updated when new ethical considerations emerge
- Informed by feedback from affected communities
- Benchmarked against industry best practices

---
