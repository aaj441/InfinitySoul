## 📞 COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES

### **Template 1: Insurance Company**
**Subject**: Reduce ADA claims by 30% [Company] portfolio

**Body**:
```
[First Name],

Quick question: How are you pricing ADA liability risk across your portfolio?

Most insurers can't quantify it. They guess. Then they get hit with claims.

We solved this. We give every company a Compliance Credit Score (0-850). Like FICO for websites.

Result: Our insurance partners reduce ADA claims by 30% through early intervention.

Worth a 15-min call to show you?

### **Template 3: Digital Agency**
**Subject**: Have you lost a client to an ADA lawsuit?

**Body**:
```
[First Name],

Brutal question: Have you lost a client because their site got hit with an ADA lawsuit?

Most agencies have. It's not their fault. But clients blame them anyway.

We prevent this. We monitor your clients 24/7, predict lawsuits 6 months early, and auto-fix violations.

Your clients never know. They just think you're incredibly proactive.

Want to see how [Agency] uses this for 30 clients?

### **Template 4: Law Firm**
**Subject**: Give your clients an ADA risk score

**Body**:
```
[First Name],

When a client asks "how at-risk are we?" what do you tell them?

Most lawyers say "it depends" and send a $10K invoice for a manual audit.

We give you a number: 620/850. Moderate risk. Lawsuit probability: 18%. Exposure: $65K.

Your clients get clarity. You get recurring revenue ($500/client/month).

## 💡 OBJECTION HANDLING

### **Objection: "This is too expensive"**
**Response**:
> "Let me show you the math. Average ADA settlement: $75K. Average legal fees: $25K. Total: $100K. Our annual cost: $30K. If we prevent one lawsuit, you save $70K. And our customers average 2.3 prevented lawsuits per year. So your ROI is 667%."

### **Objection: "We already have [AudioEye/accessiBe]"**
**Response**:
> "Great! They fix technical violations. We prevent lawsuits. Different problems. Here's what they don't do: [show threat intelligence, risk scoring, lawsuit prediction]. Those are the tools insurance companies and boards care about. Use them for fixes, use us for risk management."

### **Objection: "Our legal team needs to review"**
**Response**:
> "Smart. Here's a legal brief written by [Accessibility Attorney Name] explaining why compliance credit scores are legally defensible. It cites 15 cases. I'll also connect you with [Law Firm Partner] who uses us for 40 clients. Would that help?"

### **Objection: "We need buy-in from [executive]"**
**Response**:
> "No problem. Want me to present to them? I can do a 10-minute board-level presentation: your compliance score, your risk, and the financial case for fixing it. Executives love it because it's quantified. When can I present?"
