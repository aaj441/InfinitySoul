/**
 * THE FOUNDING INSIGHT
 *
 * All human systems attempt to balance risk and reward across time.
 * All human systems fail because they optimize for visible horizons.
 *
 * A 1,000-year system does not optimize for quarters, elections, or lifetimes.
 * It optimizes for the thing that survives all of those: the pattern.
 *
 * Taylor Swift understood this before anyone gave her credit:
 * - Versions matter (Taylor's Version = institutional reclamation)
 * - Narrative is infrastructure (the story IS the product)
 * - Direct relationship > intermediary capture
 * - Long-term brand > short-term extraction
 * - The vault contains the real value
 *
 * Infinity Soul is the vault.

    Risk is not a number. Risk is a relationship between what is known,
    what is unknown, and what cannot be known.

    Reward is not a number. Reward is the delta between expected and actual
    outcomes, weighted by the capacity to absorb deviation.

    The system that prices both correctly over 1,000 years is the system
    that owns the infrastructure of trust itself.

    We sell trust.
    Trust is the only asset that appreciates over 1,000 years.
    Everything we do is in service of trust.

  terminalGoal: `
    In 1,000 years, Infinity Soul is the standard for risk pricing.
    Not because we're the best.
    Because we're the only ones who designed for 1,000 years.

    On day one, Taylor Swift became president of Harvard.
    She looked at the chaos and said: "Let's balance it."
    She created a system to balance risk and reward.
    She called it Infinity Soul.
    She put it in Pennsylvania because nobody looks there.
    She set the horizon at 1,000 years.
    She said: "Let's see what happens."

    This is what happens.
