## Phone Call Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

```
Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Infinity Soul. Thanks for taking my call.

I help small businesses protect themselves from cyber attacks and get the 
right insurance coverage. 

I noticed [business] is online at [domain], and I'd love to offer you a free 
60-second security scan. No obligation, just want to help you see if there 
are any vulnerabilities that could put you at risk.

Does that sound helpful?
```

### If Yes - Discovery (2 minutes)

```
Great! Let me ask you a few quick questions:

1. Have you thought about cyber insurance before?
2. Do you currently have any cyber coverage?
3. What's your biggest concern about online security?
4. Do you store customer data or process payments online?
5. How many employees do you have?

[Listen for pain points and concerns]
```

### The Scan Process (1 minute)

```
Perfect. I'm going to run the scan right now while we're on the phone. 
It checks for:
- Open ports that hackers look for
- Email security weaknesses
- SSL certificate issues
- Database exposures

This takes about 60 seconds...

[Run the scan]

Okay, results are in. Let me walk you through what I found...
```

### Presenting Results (3 minutes)

#### If LOW Risk:
```
Good news! Your security score is [score]/100 - that's in the LOW risk range.

You're doing [X] things right:
- [List positive findings]

This means you're eligible for standard cyber insurance at good rates.

For a business your size, we're looking at around $[amount]/year for 
$1M in coverage. That protects you if there's a data breach, ransomware 
attack, or cyber liability claim.

Does that sound like something worth exploring?
```

#### If MEDIUM/HIGH Risk:
```
Okay, so your score is [score]/100 - that's in the [level] risk range.

Here's what that means:
1. [Main issue] - This is the biggest concern
2. [Second issue] - This also needs attention
3. [Third issue] - And this too

The good news: These are all fixable, and I can help.

Here's what I recommend:
1. Fix [critical issue] first - I can connect you with someone who can 
   do this for around $[amount], or I can help you do it yourself
2. Then address [other issues]
3. Once fixed, you'll qualify for better insurance rates

After fixes, you'd be looking at about $[amount]/year for $1M coverage.
Without fixes, you might not qualify at all, or pay 2-3x more.

Want me to help you get these fixed?
```

### Closing (2 minutes)

#### Option 1: They Want Help
```
Perfect. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll email you the full scan report
2. [If fixes needed:] I'll introduce you to [vendor/expert] who can help 
   with [fixes], or send you DIY instructions
3. Once things are fixed, I'll re-scan to verify
4. Then I'll get you quotes from 3-4 carriers and find the best rate

The whole process usually takes 1-2 weeks. Sound good?

Great! What's the best email for you?
```

#### Option 2: They Want to Think About It
```
No problem at all. Let me email you the scan report so you have it for 
your records.

A few things to keep in mind:
- [Main risk] is something you want to address soon
- Cyber attacks are increasing, especially for small businesses
- Insurance can be the difference between recovering from an attack and 
  going out of business

I'll check back in with you in [1 week/2 weeks]. Does that work?

And if you have any questions in the meantime, just reply to the email 
or give me a call. My number is [phone].
```

#### Option 3: Not Interested
```
No worries, I understand. 

Just so you know, I'm still going to send you the scan report - no charge, 
no strings attached. It's good for you to have that information.

If things change or you want to revisit this down the road, just reach out.

Thanks for your time, [Name]. Have a great day!

## Objection Handling

### "We're too small to be targeted"

```
I hear that a lot, but here's the thing: 

Hackers use automated tools that scan thousands of businesses at once. 
They're not targeting YOU specifically - they're looking for any business 
with weak security.

In fact, 43% of cyber attacks target small businesses because they're 
easier targets than big companies. And the average cost of a breach for 
a small business is $200,000.

That's why the scan is so valuable - it shows you exactly what a hacker 
would see when they scan your business.
```

### "We can't afford cyber insurance"

```
I totally get budget concerns. But here's the math:

Without insurance:
- Average data breach costs: $200,000
- Average ransomware payment: $150,000
- Legal fees and lawsuits: $100,000+

With insurance:
- Annual premium: $500-2,000
- Covered if something happens
- Peace of mind

It's like car insurance - you hope you never need it, but if something 
happens, it can save your business.

Plus, if we fix the security issues I found, your rates will be lower 
anyway. Want to at least see what it would cost?
```

### "We already have insurance"

```
That's great! A lot of businesses have general liability, but it usually 
doesn't cover cyber incidents.

Quick question: Does your current policy cover:
- Ransomware payments?
- Data breach notification costs?
- Business interruption from cyber attacks?
- Cyber liability lawsuits?

If you're not sure, I can review your policy and make sure you're actually 
protected. And if there are gaps, we can fill them.

Want me to take a look?
```

### "I'll think about it"

```
Absolutely, this is a big decision. 

Can I ask - what specific concerns do you have? Is it the cost, the coverage, 
or something else?

[Listen and address specific concern]

Here's what I'll do:
1. Send you the scan report
2. Include some resources about cyber threats
3. Follow up in [timeframe] to answer any questions

Sound good?

And just so you know - even if you don't buy insurance through me, I want 
you to be protected. So please do address [main security issue] soon. 
It's a real risk.
```
