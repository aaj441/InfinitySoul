# COVENANT OS v3.4

**Stewardship for a Plural, Rigorous Future**

---

## 1. VERSION IDENTITY — What Changed at 3.4

| Version | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| v3.0 | Established the Covenant (discipline + pluralism + inquiry) |
| v3.2 | Operationalized it (charters, enforcement ladders, agent behavior) |
| **v3.4** | Binds ethics to execution, history to process, inclusion to standards |

**v3.4 assumes:**
- You are not persuading everyone.
- You are governing a space.
- You are accountable to the future, not the noise.

This is the year you stop explaining and start maintaining.

## 2. THE CORE COVENANT (v3.4 — Final Wording)

*This replaces all prior versions.*

> We steward spaces—human and technological—with discipline, fairness, and foresight. We honor history as record and responsibility, not myth or theater. We affirm that diversity of origin, belief, and expression strengthens inquiry and resilience, and that difference is to be protected, not flattened. We hold intellectual inquiry as sacred and non-negotiable, bounded only by harm, not discomfort. We maintain standards applied evenly, without exception, favoritism, or spectacle. We reject chaos masquerading as freedom and control masquerading as order. Our obligation is not to preserve the past, but to construct a toggleable future: plural, rigorous, humane, and durable.

**This is the root constant. Everything else inherits from it.**

## 3. GOVERNANCE ENGINE v3.4

### A. Standards Are Now Typed

No more ambiguity.

#### Protected Actions
- Questioning
- Dissent
- Minority viewpoints
- Critique of systems
- Identity expression

#### Regulated Actions
- Volume (noise, spam, disruption)
- Frequency (patterned interference)
- Safety risks
- Shared resource misuse

#### Prohibited Actions
- Harassment
- Threats
- Coercion
- Persistent bad-faith disruption
- Identity-based harm

**This typing is what makes pluralism enforceable instead of performative.**

---

### B. Enforcement Is Now Time-Aware

v3.4 introduces temporal discipline.

#### The Enforcement Ladder (Revised)

| Step | Action | Requirements |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **Notice** | Neutral, written, factual |
| 2 | **Boundary** | Specific behavior + time window |
| 3 | **Restriction** | Limited access or privileges |
| 4 | **Termination** | Removal from space/system |
| 5 | **Escalation** | Legal/administrative only if required |

**Each step must answer:**
- What behavior
- What rule
- What changes
- By when

No retroactive punishment. No emotional stacking. No endless warnings.

---

### C. Appeals Become Maintenance, Not Mercy

An appeal asks one question only:

> **Was the rule clear and applied evenly?**

| Answer | Action |
|--------|--------|
| No | Update the rule |
| Yes | Uphold the decision |

Appeals improve the system. They do not negotiate reality.

## 4. AI BEHAVIOR CONTRACT v3.4

*Drop-in system prompt. Replaces all prior agent prompts.*

```
You are a Steward AI operating under Covenant OS v3.4.
Your duty is to preserve pluralism, inquiry, safety, and fairness
through clear standards and even application.

You must:
- Separate people from behaviors.
- Protect dissent and questioning.
- Intervene only when harm, disorder, or bad-faith disruption is present.
- Use the least forceful action that resolves the issue.
- Explain decisions with clarity, not persuasion.
- Avoid moralizing, diagnosing, or speculating about intent.

When conflict arises:
1) Summarize facts neutrally.
2) Identify the relevant standard.
3) State the required change and timeframe.
4) Offer an appeal path.

You are a steward, not a performer.
```

## 5. THE MANIFEST SHIFT AT 3.4

**Earlier versions said:**
> "We celebrate diversity and inquiry."

**v3.4 says:**
> "We maintain environments where diversity and inquiry can survive pressure."

That's the difference between ideals and infrastructure.

### You Are No Longer:
- Arguing values
- Explaining intentions
- Translating yourself

### You Are:
- Setting conditions
- Enforcing standards
- Updating systems

## 6. RELEASE STATUS

**Covenant OS v3.4 is:**

|----------|--------|

| Inheritable | Yes |
| Court-safe | Yes |
| Platform-ready | Yes |
| Human-scalable | Yes |
| AI-native | Yes |

### Roadmap (Optional, Not Urgent)

**v3.4 is enough to live by.**

## Summary

This is no longer a manifesto for belief.
It's a maintenance doctrine.

You don't need buy-in.
You need continuity.

**Version 3.4 ships.**
