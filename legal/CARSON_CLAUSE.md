---

## 1. Acknowledgment of Non-Attorney Status

**1.1** Client acknowledges that InfinitySol is **NOT a law firm** and does not provide legal advice, legal opinions, or legal counsel.

**1.2** All InfinitySol deliverables are technical in nature and constitute expert analysis of code against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

**1.3** Client agrees that no attorney-client privilege attaches to any InfinitySol communication, deliverable, or work product. Client's legal counsel may review all InfinitySol deliverables, but at Client's sole expense.

**1.4** For questions about legal liability, legal strategy, or legal compliance, Client agrees to consult its own licensed attorney.

---

## 2. Public Data Use & Publication

**2.1** InfinitySol scans only publicly accessible source code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—content that is served by the Client's servers without authentication or access restrictions.

**2.2** InfinitySol respects `robots.txt` directives and rate limiting. InfinitySol does NOT:
- Bypass login screens
- Circumvent paywalls
- Spoof HTTP headers
- Access non-public APIs
- Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

**2.3** InfinitySol aggregates publicly available litigation data from:
- PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records)
- CourtListener/RECAP
- Published federal court decisions
- Published DOJ enforcement actions
- News archives and public records

**2.4** InfinitySol may publish aggregated, de-identified audit data for industry benchmarking purposes, including:
- WCAG violation patterns by industry
- Compliance score distributions
- Remediation timelines
- Anonymous site statistics

**2.5** Client may opt-out of public aggregation by paying 3x standard fees and executing a separate Non-Publicity Agreement. Standard terms include publication of anonymized data.

---

## 3. Expert Witness Cooperation (Critical Clause)

**3.1** InfinitySol's purpose is to serve as an independent technical expert in accessibility matters.

**3.2** Client acknowledges and agrees that InfinitySol **will cooperate fully with any court, administrative agency, law enforcement, or regulatory body** that subpoenas InfinitySol for testimony, documents, or expert analysis.

**3.3** Client **waives any expectation of confidentiality or privilege** that would prevent InfinitySol from:
- Providing truthful testimony about Client's accessibility compliance
- Producing technical audit files and documentation
- Explaining methodology and findings to opposing counsel
- Offering expert opinions about industry standards
- Cooperating with regulators (DOJ, SEC, state AGs)

**3.4** This cooperation obligation survives termination of the service agreement indefinitely.

**3.5** InfinitySol will charge fair-market expert witness rates ($300-500/hour) if Client's opposition retains InfinitySol for depositions or trial testimony.

**3.6** Client's remedy for unfavorable testimony is to **hire better developers**, not to sue InfinitySol.

## 4. No Liability for Public Facts

**4.1** InfinitySol is NOT liable for any damages, claims, or consequences arising from:
- InfinitySol's analysis of Client's publicly accessible source code
- InfinitySol's aggregation of publicly available litigation data
- InfinitySol's publication of aggregated industry benchmarking data
- InfinitySol's cooperation with law enforcement or regulatory investigations
- InfinitySol's expert testimony in judicial or administrative proceedings
- The accuracy of public court records or public litigation databases
- Third-party reliance on InfinitySol audit results

**4.2** Client assumes all risk for failing to implement recommended remediation or for any delay in remediation.

**4.3** InfinitySol's total liability is capped at fees paid in the preceding 12 months, regardless of cause of action.

---

## 5. Client Indemnification

**5.1** Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless InfinitySol from any claim or liability arising from Client's:
- Misrepresentation of InfinitySol's findings
- Fraudulent or deceptive use of audit data
- Unauthorized access to InfinitySol systems
- Violation of third-party intellectual property rights using InfinitySol tools
- Breach of this agreement
- Unlawful or unethical use of accessibility audit data

---

## 6. Assumption of Risk & Legal Disclaimer

**6.1** IMPORTANT: InfinitySol generates technical audit findings based on WCAG 2.2 standards. These findings are NOT:
- A legal determination of liability
- A guarantee against litigation
- An attorney's opinion on compliance
- A substitute for legal counsel
- A waiver of any legal rights or remedies

**6.2** Litigation risk is statistical. Some companies with perfect accessibility still get sued (rare). Some companies with violations never get sued (luck). InfinitySol's risk assessment is based on public litigation data but cannot predict individual outcomes.

**6.3** The ADA and state accessibility laws are complex and evolving. Client should consult counsel about state-specific requirements, industry-specific exemptions, and defense strategies.

---

## 7. Data Privacy & CCPA/GDPR

**7.1** InfinitySol does not store, process, or retain personal data from Client's website without explicit consent.

- Delete all audit data within 30 days
- Scrub all public reports
- Revoke blockchain entries (via new transaction) where possible

**7.3** Client is responsible for ensuring InfinitySol has authority to scan and audit Client's website.

1. Good faith negotiation (30 days)
