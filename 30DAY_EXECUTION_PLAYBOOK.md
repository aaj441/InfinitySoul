## 🗓 THE TIMELINE (Dec 3 - Dec 13)

### PHASE 1: IGNITION (The "Setup" is Over)

#### Wednesday, Dec 03: The Foundation
- [ ] **Deploy Production:** Merge PR #5 immediately. Confirm Vercel/Railway live URLs.
- [ ] **Stripe Live Mode:** Activate Stripe account. Create "$499/mo Compliance Guard" product link.
- [ ] **The "Godfather" Offer:** Draft the cold email/DM.
      - *Hook:* "I scanned [Company] and found 14 legal liabilities. Here is the report."
      - *CTA:* "Fix it for $499/mo (cheaper than one hour of your lawyer's time)."

#### Thursday, Dec 04: Data Harvesting
- [ ] **Run the Scraper:** Target 500 URLs in "Litigation Danger Zones" (Dentists, local law firms, small banks).
- [ ] **Filter & Sort:** Discard secure sites. Isolate the bottom 20% (Red Alert sites).
- [ ] **Generate 50 Audit PDFs:** Use the automated reporter to create the "Weaponized Audits."

---

### PHASE 2: AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH (Volume is Key)

#### Friday, Dec 05: First Strike
- [ ] **Send 50 Personalized Emails:** Attach the PDF. Subject: "Accessibility Liability Report for [Domain]"
- [ ] **LinkedIn DM Sprint:** Find the owners/partners of these firms. "Sent you a compliance report. Check email."

#### Saturday, Dec 06: The Follow-Up (No Days Off)
- [ ] **Re-hit Unopened Emails:** Change subject line. "Urgent: Legal exposure on [Domain]"
- [ ] **Batch 2:** Scan next 500 URLs. Generate next 50 reports.

#### Sunday, Dec 07: Review & Pivot

---

### PHASE 3: CLOSING & SCALING

#### Monday, Dec 08: The Flood
- [ ] **Sales Calls/Demos:** Do not schedule for "next week." Schedule for *today* or *tomorrow*.
- [ ] **Close First 3 Clients:** Goal: $1,500 ARR secured.
- [ ] **Ask for Referrals:** "Who else in your network has a site like this?"

#### Tuesday, Dec 09: Automation
- [ ] **Automate the Follow-up:** Set up the email sequence to auto-bump non-responders.
- [ ] **Refine the Pitch:** Handle the #1 objection heard yesterday (likely "Is this real law?"). Add that answer to the FAQ/Email.

#### Wednesday, Dec 10: Mid-Week Sprint
- [ ] **Bulk Outreach:** Send 200 generic (template) emails to lower-priority leads.
- [ ] **Close Clients 4-10:** Momentum builds.

## 🎬 WINNING OBJECTION HANDLING

| Objection | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Is this legal?" | "Based on public court records (PACER). I'm not a lawyer, but I show you the data." |
| "We already use [XYZ tool]" | "They find issues. I fix them. Different service." |
| "Too expensive" | "How much would a settlement cost? This is insurance." |
| "We'll do it ourselves" | "That takes 3-6 months. Lawsuits don't wait. I can help." |
| "Need to discuss with team" | "Let's schedule a 15-min demo with them. Today or tomorrow?" |

## 🔥 THE MINDSET

This isn't a marketing sprint. This is a **revenue guarantee**.

Every company you contact has an accessibility problem.
Every problem has a lawsuit attached.
Every lawsuit costs more than your service.

You're not selling compliance.
You're selling lawsuit insurance.

**The only question is:** Will they buy it from you, or learn the hard way?
