- **Valuation**: 10x EBITDA = $600M
- **Retain**: IS Fiber (claims graph network fees)
- **Community**: 20% of exit = $120M distributed to $SOUL holders

### 2030: Sell Protocol to Salesforce
- **Valuation**: 18x ARR = $900M
- **Retain**: IS Fiber perpetual network fees
- **Community**: 20% of exit = $180M distributed

### Forever: IS Fiber Network Fees

## The Kluge Principles

1. **Buy distressed** (MGAs at 0.5x book value)
2. **Centralize ops** (shared underwriting, claims, reinsurance)
3. **Cut costs ruthlessly** (agents replace humans where possible)
4. **Graduate cells** (spin out profitable MGAs as standalone entities)
5. **Keep the rails** (IS Fiber network fees in perpetuity)
6. **Sell at peak** (10x-18x exits to strategic buyers)

## The Murdoch Money, Indie Soul Promise

**Major label money** (VC, debt, cloud credits) funds:
- MGA acquisitions
- Agent development
- Infrastructure scaling

**Indie soul** (community governance, open-source, ethical constraints) ensures:
- Artists (researchers, security practitioners) own 20%

- A&Rs (governance) are the community (token votes)

**The label head** (you) keeps the rails (IS Fiber) but **the stations are free** (spun-out cells).
