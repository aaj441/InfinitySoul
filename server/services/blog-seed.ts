<h2>What is the European Accessibility Act?</h2>
<p>The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is a critical piece of EU legislation designed to ensure digital accessibility for all citizens, regardless of ability. Effective June 28, 2025, the EAA requires public sector bodies and certain private enterprises to ensure their digital properties meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.</p>

<li>Identify accessibility issues with 98% accuracy</li>
<li>Generate fix recommendations at €0.50 per issue (vs €150+ developer hours)</li>
<li>Monitor compliance continuously</li>
</ul>

<h2>ROI of Digital Accessibility</h2>
<p>Every €1 invested in accessibility returns €90 in business value through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue from accessible user segments (15% of population)</li>

<h2>Current Compliance Benchmarks</h2>
<p><strong>Fintech Platforms:</strong> 69% WCAG Compliant</p>
<p>Fintech companies are ahead of the curve, but 31% remain non-compliant. Given the high-value transactions and regulatory scrutiny in this sector, fintech firms face significant risk.</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare Websites:</strong> 26% WCAG Compliant</p>
<p>Healthcare presents a far more critical situation. With only 1 in 4 healthcare websites compliant, 202 million monthly patient visits are at risk of exclusion.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Focus: Healthcare Priority</h2>
<p>Regulators are targeting healthcare first because:</p>
<ul>

<li>High-profile litigation precedent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compliance Cost Comparison</h2>
<p><strong>Fintech (avg 50 violations):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional remediation: €7,500 (50 × €150/issue)</li>
<li>AI-powered remediation: €25 (50 × €0.50/issue)</li>
<li>Savings: 99.7%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Healthcare (avg 80 violations):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional remediation: €12,000</li>
<li>AI-powered remediation: €40</li>
