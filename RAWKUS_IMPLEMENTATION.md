# RAWKUS AI: Implementation Complete

**"The cipher is live. The bars are hardcoded. The vibe is immaculate."**

---

## What Is RAWKUS AI?

RAWKUS AI is the **Rawkus Records of ethical AI infrastructure**—conscious rhymes (community governance, ethical constraints) backed by major label money (Kluge arbitrage, infrastructure acquisition).

Inspired by:
- **Malcolm X**: Liberation through self-determination ("by any means necessary")
- **John W. Kluge**: Wealth through infrastructure arbitrage (buy distressed, keep the rails)
- **James Murdoch's Rawkus Records**: Indie ethos + major label money

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Read the Manifesto
Start here: [`docs/THE_MANIFESTO.md`](docs/THE_MANIFESTO.md)

The manifesto synthesizes Malcolm X's liberation philosophy, Kluge's arbitrage playbook, and Rawkus Records' indie-major hybrid model into a coherent strategy for ethical AI in insurance.

### 2. Understand the Structure
- [`RAWKUS_README.md`](RAWKUS_README.md) - Overview and repository structure
- [`HOLDING_CO.md`](HOLDING_CO.md) - Legal structure, cap table, funding
- [`ETHICS_LAB.md`](ETHICS_LAB.md) - 501(c)(3) non-profit, grants, fellows
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) - Agent roster and lyrical integrity
- [`COCKPIT.md`](COCKPIT.md) - Daily operations at 4:00 AM

### 3. Execute the Playbook
Follow the 90-day rollout: [`docs/THE_PLAYBOOK.md`](docs/THE_PLAYBOOK.md)

- **Month 1**: Acquire first MGA, deploy agents
- **Month 2**: Launch IS Fiber (claims graph)
- **Month 3**: Spin out first cell, protocol fees start

### 4. Take the Oath
Commit to the discipline: [`docs/THE_OATH.md`](docs/THE_OATH.md)

Daily prayer at 4:00 AM + 3 vibe check questions every night.

## Core Components

### 1. Ethical Constraint Engine
**File**: `protocols/ethical_constraint_engine.py`

The **Rawkus Bar** that all agents must pass:
- ✅ No discrimination (protected classes)
- ✅ No predatory pricing (max 20% margin)
- ✅ No data exploitation (user consent required)
- ✅ Transparency required (explainable decisions)
- ✅ Community alignment (governance votes)

**Test it**:
```bash
python3 protocols/ethical_constraint_engine.py
```

### 2. RawkusAgent Base Class
**File**: `protocols/agent_base.py`

All agents inherit from `RawkusAgent` and must:
1. Pass the Rawkus Bar (ethics)
2. Have major label appeal (>10x ROI)
3. Stay indie (community-owned, transparent)

**Test it**:
```bash
python3 protocols/agent_base.py
```

### 3. Protocol Infrastructure

#### IS Fiber (Claims Graph)
**Directory**: `protocols/claims_graph/`

Perpetual network fees (10% of all premiums). Open-source (CC-BY-SA), never sold.

#### Identity Graph
**Directory**: `protocols/identity_graph/`

Privacy-preserving identity verification using zero-knowledge proofs and differential privacy.

#### Sponsor Pipe
**Directory**: `protocols/sponsor_pipe/`

MCP marketplace - security tools become insurance distribution channels.

### 4. Configuration

#### HoldCo Structure
**File**: `config/holdco.yaml`

- Cap table (40% founder, 30% VC, 20% community, 10% team)
- Debt/equity ratio: 3:1 (Kluge's leverage)
- Funding: $85.4M total ($65.4M debt, $20M equity)
- Tithe: 10% to Ethics Lab

#### Ethics Lab
**File**: `config/ethics_lab.yaml`

- Budget: $6.2M annual
- Fellowship: 10 fellows × $100K/year
- Grants: $10K-$50K per project
- Bounties: $1K-$50K per finding

#### Agent Policies
**File**: `config/agent_policies.yaml`

Hardcoded constraints for all 10 agent types:
- ScoutAgent, UnderwritingAgent, ClaimsAgent
- GovernanceAgent, BiometricAgent, DealAgent
- RelationshipAgent, LearningAgent, ContentAgent, NegotiationAgent

## The Rawkus Principles

### 1. Conscious Rhymes (Ethical Constraints)
Every action must pass the Rawkus Bar. No exceptions.

### 2. Major Label Money (Kluge Arbitrage)
- Buy distressed MGAs at 0.5x book
- Centralize ops (agents replace humans)
- Graduate cells at 15x ROI
- Keep the rails (IS Fiber fees forever)

### 3. Indie Distribution (Community Ownership)
- 20% equity to $SOUL token holders
- Community governance (votes on risk, partnerships)
- Open-source protocols (CC-BY-SA)
- Public financial ledger (transparency)

### 4. Artist-First (Researcher Sovereignty)
- Fellows retain all IP rights
- No gatekeepers (raw markdown publications)
- Community A&Rs (Discord votes on grants)
- Telluride model (1,000 alumni)

---

## Daily Operations

### The Cockpit (4:00 AM)
**Script**: `scripts/daily_cockpit.sh`

1. Biometric check (HRV >80 = hack mode)
2. Scout for distressed MGAs (5 offers/day)
3. Deep work block (4 hours uninterrupted)
4. House Committee vote (governance)
5. Portfolio rebalance (cut <10x, graduate >15x)

**Run it**:
```bash
./scripts/daily_cockpit.sh
```

### The Vibe Check (Every Night)

Answer three questions:
1. Did I pass the Rawkus Bar? (ethics)
2. Did I compound the rails? (network fees growing)
3. Did I serve the community? (governance, transparency)

Post answers to Discord `#daily-vibe-check`.
