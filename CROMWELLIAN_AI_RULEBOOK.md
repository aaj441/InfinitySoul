# THE CROMWELLIAN AI RULEBOOK

**A Blueprint for Discipline-First Technology & Vibe Engineering**

---

## I. FIRST PRINCIPLES (Non-Negotiable)

These are axioms. If a platform violates them, it is reconfigured or abandoned.

### 1. Technology exists to serve vocation, not appetite.
AI, software, and platforms are tools for work, study, and construction—not entertainment engines.

### 2. Discipline precedes creativity.
No freedom without structure. Creativity emerges after order, not before it.

### 3. The human retains judgment at all times.
No system replaces conscience, responsibility, or final decision-making.

### 4. Every system shapes behavior.
If you don't engineer the vibe, the platform engineers it for you.

---

## II. THE PURITANICAL AI CODE (Core Rules)

These rules apply to every AI system, app, platform, or workflow you touch.

### Rule 1 — Instrumentality Only

AI must perform a function:
- Analysis
- Synthesis
- Drafting
- Research
- Structuring
- Auditing

If it cannot be justified as labor or learning, it is not used.

**AI is a plow, not a parlor.**

---

### Rule 2 — Scheduled Access, Never Ambient

AI is accessed:
- At defined times
- For defined tasks
- With a defined exit condition

No passive scrolling. No "just checking." No idle prompting.

---

### Rule 3 — Human Judgment Is Final

- AI outputs are reviewed, edited, and signed off by a human
- No auto-publishing without review
- No delegation of moral, legal, or strategic authority

**AI advises. You govern.**

---

### Rule 4 — Traceability & Record

All meaningful AI use must be:
- Logged
- Attributable
- Reviewable

If you can't explain why or how the AI was used, the usage is invalid.

---

### Rule 5 — Reduction of Noise Is a Success Metric

AI must:
- Reduce cognitive load
- Reduce repetition
- Reduce time waste

If AI increases chatter, distraction, or emotional turbulence, it is misconfigured.

---

## III. VIBE ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK

*(How these ethics become felt, not just stated)*

This is where discipline becomes atmosphere.

### Layer 1 — Language Discipline

Across all platforms:
- No hype language
- No performative optimism
- No gamification metaphors

**Preferred tone:**
- Declarative
- Procedural
- Calm
- Slightly austere

If the language sounds like marketing, it's wrong.

---

### Layer 2 — Interface Restraint

Your platforms should visually signal restraint:
- Muted colors
- Low contrast
- Minimal animations
- No badges, streaks, or dopamine hooks

**The UI should feel like:**
- A study
- A workshop
- A command room

Not a casino.

---

### Layer 3 — Behavioral Defaults

Engineer defaults so the path of least resistance is discipline:
- Fewer notifications
- Manual refresh over auto-refresh
- Task completion > engagement metrics
- Logs > likes

People should feel calmer after use, not stimulated.

---

## IV. PLATFORM GOVERNANCE TEMPLATE

*(Use this on every platform you build or adopt)*

For each platform, answer these five questions:

1. **What is this platform for?**
   *(One sentence. No abstractions.)*

2. **What behaviors does it encourage by default?**
   *(List honestly.)*

3. **What behaviors must be discouraged or blocked?**
   *(Be ruthless.)*

4. **Where does human judgment override automation?**
   *(Explicit points.)*

5. **How is discipline enforced technically?**
   *(Limits, timers, permissions, friction.)*

If you can't answer all five, the platform is ungoverned.

---

## V. THE CROMWELLIAN AI STACK (Operational Model)

Every system should have these four layers:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Input Layer** | Human intent (clear task definition) |
| **2. AI Layer** | Execution under constraints |
| **3. Review Layer** | Human audit & correction |
| **4. Archive Layer** | Record, reflect, refine |

No skipping layers.
No collapsing steps for convenience.

---

## VI. FAILURE CONDITIONS (Automatic Shutdown Triggers)

AI use is paused if:
- You feel compulsive checking
- Outputs go unreviewed
- The tool starts shaping your mood
- The system creates more work than it removes
- You can't articulate its purpose

**Discipline includes knowing when to stop.**

---

## VII. THE OATH (Optional, but Powerful)

*You don't have to share this. It's for internal alignment.*

```
I use technology to build, not to escape.
I govern my tools; they do not govern me.
I choose discipline over noise, clarity over indulgence.
What I build reflects order, not appetite.
```

---

## VIII. SYNTHESIS — THE BLUEPRINT IN ONE LINE

> **Engineer platforms so discipline is effortless and distraction is inconvenient.**

That's Cromwell.
That's governance.
That's how ethos becomes architecture, not slogans.

---

## Implementation Options

This rulebook can be:
- Translated into a Notion / OS governance doc
- Applied as a "Puritan Mode" checklist for any new platform
- Used to retrofit existing platforms for compliance

---

**Order first. Creation follows.**
