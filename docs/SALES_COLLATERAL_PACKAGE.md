**Industry:** [Fintech / Healthtech / Legaltech]  
**Size:** [Employees]  
**Challenge:** [Manual audits blocking releases]

---

**THE CHALLENGE:**

Before WCAG AI Platform, [Client] was spending [X hours/week] on manual accessibility audits. Their ops team:
- Manually tested every feature release (40+ hours/month)
- Missed violations that customers found in production
- Couldn't ship features fast enough (compliance bottleneck)

**Week 3:** Team fixed 92% of critical issues (AI recommendations)  
**Week 4:** Compliance score improved from 62% → 91%

---

**THE RESULTS:**

- ✅ **85% time savings** (40 hours → 6 hours per audit)
- ✅ **10x faster** violation detection (2 min vs. 20 min per page)
- ✅ **Zero production violations** (caught before launch)
- ✅ **$180K cost savings** (avoided hiring 2 QA engineers)

**Metrics:**
- Scans per month: 120
- Violations fixed: 147 → 12 remaining
- Time to compliance: 4 weeks (was 6 months)
- ROI: 7.2x within first quarter

**OBJECTION HANDLING (built into demo)**

**Objection 1:** "We already have a manual process."  
**You:** "I get it. But how long does each audit take? [They say 20-40 hours]. With us, it's 2 minutes. You could audit 10x more sites in the same time."

**Objection 2:** "We need to test ourselves, not rely on AI."  
**You:** "Totally fair. That's why we show confidence scores. High confidence = trust it. Low confidence = human review. You're still in control."

**Objection 3:** "What about false positives?"  
**You:** "Great question. Our false positive rate is 8% (and dropping). That means 92% of what we flag is real. We're constantly improving."

**Objection 4:** "We need custom rules for our vertical."  
**You:** "That's Enterprise tier ($25K+/mo). We build fintech-specific, healthtech-specific rules. Want to chat about that?"

---

**CLOSE (2 min)**

**You:** So based on what you've seen, does this solve your [pain point]?

**[If YES]:**
**You:** Awesome. Two options:
1. **Free 14-day trial** (no credit card, full access)
2. **Paid plan** (starts at $2.5K/mo, cancel anytime)

Which makes more sense for you?

**[If NO / "Need to think about it"]:**
**You:** No problem. What's holding you back? [Address concern]

If still hesitant:
**You:** How about this: I'll send you a free audit of your website. No strings attached. See the value first. Fair?

## 4. EMAIL TEMPLATES (Cold Outreach)

### Template A: Fintech Ops Manager

**Subject:** Quick question on fintech compliance

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I've been auditing fintech compliance workflows, and I'm seeing the same pattern: ops teams spend 40% of their time on manual accessibility audits instead of shipping features.

I built an AI tool that automates this. It scans your app, prioritizes violations by regulatory risk, and generates compliance reports automatically.

Does this resonate with what your team's dealing with right now?

Open to a 15-minute call if it does.

—Aaron

---

### Template B: Healthtech Compliance Officer

**Subject:** Healthcare teams: accessibility + HIPAA

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I've been looking at healthtech workflows, and something stuck out: your compliance team has to track TWO things:
1. HIPAA (data privacy)
2. ADA/WCAG (accessibility)

Most teams treat these separately, which creates gaps.

I built a tool that combines both: scan for accessibility issues AND verify HIPAA compliance on the same audit.

Saves your compliance team 6+ hours per audit.

Worth a quick call?

—Aaron

---

### Template C: Legaltech CIO

**Subject:** Law firms & accessibility: your biggest liability

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I've been looking at legal tech stacks, and found something: most law firms use tools that aren't accessible.

This creates a problem: clients can't use your tech = potential ADA lawsuit.

Worse: you (a legal firm) could be sued for not providing accessible legal tech.

I built a tool that audits your tech stack for accessibility AND documents why it matters (good for internal arguments).

Makes it easy to tell your CTO: "We need accessible tools."

15 mins?

## 5. OBJECTION HANDLING CHEAT SHEET

### Common Objections + Responses

**Objection 1:** "We already have a vendor for this."

**Response:**
"That's great! Are they catching violations before production, or are you finding them after customers report them? [Pause for answer]. Most vendors only scan static pages. We scan JavaScript-heavy apps, SPAs, and dynamic content. Want to see a side-by-side comparison?"

---

**Objection 2:** "Accessibility isn't a priority right now."

**Response:**
"I totally understand. But have you seen the trend in WCAG lawsuits in [industry]? [Show stat: '93% of fintech companies face lawsuits']. The question isn't *if* you'll need this, it's *when*. Would you rather be proactive or reactive?"

---

**Objection 3:** "We need to test manually, not trust AI."

**Response:**
"Absolutely. That's why we show confidence scores on every recommendation. High confidence (90%+) = trust it. Low confidence (< 60%) = human review required. You're still in control. The AI just accelerates the obvious stuff."

---

**Objection 4:** "What if we have custom requirements?"

**Response:**
"That's Enterprise tier. We build custom rules for your vertical (fintech-specific, healthtech-specific). We also consult on your compliance strategy. Sound like what you need? Let's talk pricing."

---

**Objection 5:** "We can't afford this right now."

**Response:**
"I get it. Budget's tight. But here's the thing: you're spending [X hours/month] on manual audits. That's [Y salary cost]. Our tool costs $2.5K-7.5K/mo and saves you 80% of that time. You're not spending money—you're saving it. Want me to run the ROI calc with you?"

---

**Objection 6:** "We need to see it work first."

**Response:**
"Fair. How about this: I'll audit your website for free (no strings attached). You see the results, decide if it's useful. If it is, we talk pricing. If not, you got a free audit. Deal?"

---

**Objection 7:** "We're worried about false positives."

**Response:**
"Great question. Our false positive rate is 8% (and dropping monthly as the AI learns). That means 92% of what we flag is real. Plus, we show you *why* we think it's a violation. You verify, we improve. Fair?"

---

**Objection 8:** "What about data privacy? We can't share our violations."

**Response:**
"We take privacy seriously. Your data never leaves your silo. We don't share Company A's violations with Company B. Only anonymized, aggregated metrics (like '80% of fintech teams fix this way'). We're SOC 2 certified [or 'working towards certification']."

## 7. ROI CALCULATOR (Show Value)

### Manual Audit Cost Breakdown

**Scenario:** Ops Manager at fintech company

**Current State (Manual Audits):**
- Audits per month: 5
- Hours per audit: 20 hours
- Hourly rate (loaded): $75/hour
- **Monthly cost:** 5 × 20 × $75 = **$7,500**

**With WCAG AI Platform:**
- Audits per month: 25 (5x more)
- Hours per audit: 4 hours (80% reduction)
- Tool cost: $7,500/month (PRO tier)
- **Monthly cost:** (25 × 4 × $75) + $7,500 = **$15,000**

**BUT:**
- You're now auditing **5x more clients**
- You can charge **$5K per audit** (instead of $10K because it's faster)
- **Revenue:** 25 × $5K = **$125K/month**
- **Profit:** $125K - $15K = **$110K/month**

**ROI:** 7.3x within first quarter

## 10. LINKEDIN POST TEMPLATES (Thought Leadership)

### Post A: Problem Awareness

**Title:** "Why accessibility audits are killing your release velocity"

**Body:**
I've talked to 50+ ops managers at fintech companies.

Same story every time:
- Features ready to ship
- Blocked on accessibility audit
- Manual testing takes 20-40 hours
- Customers waiting

The fix isn't hiring more QA engineers.

It's automation.

AI can scan your entire app in 2 minutes. Finds violations you'd miss. Prioritizes by regulatory risk.

Accessibility shouldn't be a bottleneck. It should be a checkbox.

---

### Post B: Social Proof

**Title:** "How [Client] reduced audit time by 85%"

**Body:**
[Client Name] was spending 40 hours/month on manual WCAG audits.

They switched to WCAG AI Platform.

Results after 30 days:
- 85% time savings (40 hours → 6 hours)
- 10x more scans (5 → 50 sites audited)
- Zero production violations (caught before launch)

The ops manager told me:
> "Accessibility used to be our biggest blocker. Now it's a competitive advantage."

Automation isn't replacing compliance teams. It's accelerating them.

---

### Post C: Industry Insight

**Title:** "93% of fintech companies will face accessibility lawsuits"

**Body:**
That's not hyperbole. It's data.

ADA lawsuits targeting fintech jumped 300% in 2024.

Why?
- Payment flows aren't accessible
- Mobile apps fail WCAG standards
- Compliance teams overwhelmed

The companies that survive aren't the ones with perfect accessibility.

They're the ones who:
1. Audit proactively (not reactively)
2. Automate detection (not manual)
3. Document everything (regulatory defense)

The lawsuit wave is here. Are you ready?
