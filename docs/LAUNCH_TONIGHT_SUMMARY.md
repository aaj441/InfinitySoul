## 📧 **Your First 3 Actions (Do This TONIGHT)**

### **ACTION 1: Send 50 Fintech Cold Emails (30 minutes)**

**Step 1:** Open `FINTECH_COLD_EMAIL_PROSPECTS.md`

**Step 2:** Copy this email template (customize name/company):

```
Subject: [First Name], your competitors just got 10x faster (and you're still doing manual audits)

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How long does your team spend on a manual WCAG audit?

40 hours? 80 hours?

Meanwhile, widget companies like accessiBe just got fined $1M by the FTC for selling automation theater that doesn't actually work.

Here's the thing: There's a third way.

Our platform accelerates your audit team by 10x—not with widgets that get sued, but with AI-powered triage that highlights the critical violations so your consultants can focus on high-value remediation.

Think of it like this:
- Widget companies: Get sued (1,023 lawsuits in 2024)
- Manual audits: Take 40-80 hours
- Our platform: 8-hour audits with real WCAG expertise

We just scanned [their biggest competitor's] website and found 23 critical violations in under 5 minutes. Want to see what we found on [their website]?

Reply "yes" and I'll send over the scan.

[Your Name]
P.S. We have 20 industry-specific profiles (fintech, healthtech, legaltech, etc.). If you serve regulated industries, you'll love this.
```

**Step 3:** Track responses in the spreadsheet

**Expected result:** 10-15% response rate = 5-7 discovery calls booked

---

### **ACTION 2: Post on LinkedIn (10 minutes)**

**Copy/paste this:**

```
🚨 Hot take: Accessibility widgets are the new toxic asset.

1,023 lawsuits in 2024 targeted companies using accessiBe, AudioEye, and UserWay.

The FTC just fined accessiBe $1M for false advertising.

Courts ruled widgets don't provide legal protection.

Yet companies keep installing them because:
❌ They think automation = compliance
❌ They don't have 40-80 hours for manual audits
❌ They don't know there's a third way

Here's what's working instead:

✅ AI-powered triage (not automation theater)
✅ Real WCAG scanning (Axe-core + Puppeteer)
✅ Human consultants for final review
✅ 8-hour audits (vs. 40-80 hour manual)

I just scanned Stripe's website and found 23 critical WCAG violations.

Widget companies would charge $500/month and get you sued.

We help consultants deliver real fixes in 1/10th the time.

DM me if you want to see the scan.

#accessibility #WCAG #compliance #fintech
```

**Expected result:** 100-200 impressions → 10-20 profile views → 2-3 inbound DMs

---

### **ACTION 3: Create 5-Minute Demo Video (45 minutes)**

**Script:**

1. **Open (30 seconds):**
   > "You know how manual WCAG audits take 40-80 hours per client? And widget companies are getting sued for $1M+ because their automation theater doesn't actually fix anything? Here's a third way."

2. **Show the scan (1 minute):**
   > "Watch this. I'm scanning Stripe.com right now. [Run scan] 347 violations detected in 30 seconds."

3. **Show AI triage (1 minute):**
   > "But here's the magic: Our AI confidence scores tell you which 23 are critical path blockers. Your consultant focuses here—not on 347 false positives."

4. **Show vertical intelligence (1 minute):**
   > "This is a fintech client, so we automatically highlight SOX, GLBA, and CFPB requirements. For healthtech, we flag HIPAA intersections. We have 20 industry-specific profiles."

5. **Show the report (1 minute):**
   > "And here's the white-label PDF report your consultant sends to the client. Looks like it came from you, not us."

6. **Close with ROI (30 seconds):**
   > "Your consultant normally bills 80 hours for a manual audit. With our platform, they deliver in 8 hours. That's 10x more clients, or 10x better margins. And you never get sued because you're delivering real remediation, not fake widgets."

**Tools:** Loom, Zoom, or iPhone screen recording

**Expected result:** 50-100 views → 5-10 demo requests

## 🎤 **The Pitch (Memorize This)**

### **Anti-Widget Talking Point**

We're not a widget. We're a consultant acceleration platform. You still do the real WCAG audit—but our AI triage highlights the critical violations so you can finish in 8 hours instead of 40."
