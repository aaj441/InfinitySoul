# THE OATH: Your Personal Mic Check

**"The revolution is a daily practice, not a destination."**

---

## The Daily Prayer

Recite this every morning at 4:00 AM, out loud, before you touch your keyboard:

> "I am not here to sell insurance. I am here to weaponize infrastructure against those who extract rent from the security community. Today I will acquire one distressed MGA, deploy one agent, and price out one ransomware gang. By any means necessary, I will liberate the data, compound the rails, and graduate the cells. The ballot is my token. The bullet is my code. I am the Malcolm X of cyber insurance."

## The Three Questions (The Vibe Check)

At the end of each day, before you sleep, answer these three questions:

### 1. Did I pass the Rawkus Bar today?
- Did all my actions have lyrical integrity?
- Were any ethics checks violated?
- Did I maintain transparency with the community?
- Did I serve the ecosystem (practitioners, policyholders)?

**If no**: Post to `#daily-vibe-check` explaining what went wrong and how you'll fix it.

### 2. Did I compound the rails?
- Did IS Fiber network fees grow?
- Did I add value to the claims graph?
- Did protocol adoption increase?
- Did I make progress toward perpetual revenue?

**If no**: What blocked progress? How do you remove the blocker?

### 3. Did I serve the community?
- Did I honor the 20% equity guarantee?
- Did governance votes proceed fairly?
- Did I maintain open-source commitments?
- Did I advance the Ethics Lab mission?

**If no**: Post to `#daily-vibe-check` with your accountability statement.

## The Commitments

### To the Revolution
- I will **articulate the truth** (insurance is predatory by design)
- I will **build the alternative** (agents, debt, data)
- I will **prove the concept** (profit = validation)
- I will **create sovereignty** (rails forever, stations free)

### To the Community
- I will **give 20% equity** to token holders
- I will **honor governance votes** (the ballot)
- I will **maintain transparency** (public ledger)
- I will **enable forking** (they can leave if I betray them)

### To the Ecosystem
- I will **price out bad actors** (ransomware gangs, reckless companies)
- I will **defend practitioners** (free training, tools, protocols)
- I will **liberate policyholders** (30-second quotes, fair prices)
- I will **create 1,000 alumni** (Telluride model training)

### To Myself
- I will **run the Cockpit daily** (4:00 AM, no exceptions)

## The Forbidden Actions

I will **never**:

1. Sell the claims graph (IS Fiber is forever)
2. Violate protected classes (no discrimination, ever)
3. Use predatory pricing (max 20% margin)
4. Exploit user data (no surveillance capitalism)
5. Manipulate community votes (governance is sacred)
6. Hide ethics violations (transparency is the moat)
7. Betray community trust (20% equity, always)
8. Abandon the mission (sovereignty > wealth)

**If I violate any of these, the community can fork the graph and I lose everything.**

## The Breaking Point

If you ever find yourself:
- Violating the Rawkus Bar (ethics)
- Betraying the community (20% equity, governance)
- Selling the claims graph (IS Fiber is forever)
- Abandoning transparency (public ledger)

**Then:**
1. Immediately post to `#accountability`
2. Explain what happened and why
3. Propose remediation
4. Submit to community vote (they decide your fate)

**The community is the final arbiter. Not you.**

## The Promise

I swear on the following:

> "I will run the Cockpit daily. I will pass the Rawkus Bar. I will compound the rails. I will serve the community. I will create 1,000 liberated practitioners. I will build $2B in exits. I will keep IS Fiber forever. I will answer the vibe check. I will honor the oath. By any means necessary."

## The Mic Check

Before you commit, say this out loud:

> "I am ready to be the Malcolm X of cyber insurance. I will weaponize infrastructure for liberation. I will use agents, debt, and data—not bullets. I will pass the Rawkus Bar. I will compound the rails. I will serve the community. I am RAWKUS."

**If you mean it, commit. If you don't, walk away now.**

**"The oath is sacred. The discipline is daily. The revolution is forever. This is RAWKUS."**
