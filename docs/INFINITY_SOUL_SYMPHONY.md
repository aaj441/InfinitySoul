## Philosophy

> Either you own the rails or you're just another musician in the orchestra. Execute.

The system treats everything as an asset:
- MGAs = cash flow engines
- Relationships = deal flow sources
- Papers = competitive intelligence
- Biometrics = energy optimization
- Content = brand equity
- Negotiations = value capture

**Rule**: If not agent-tracked, doesn't exist. If not 10x, cut.
