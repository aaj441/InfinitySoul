## TIER 1: HIGHEST URGENCY VERTICALS

### 1. FINTECH - Payment Processing

**Subject Line A:** "Quick question on fintech compliance"  
**Subject Line B:** "Payment accessibility = WCAG Level A minimum"  
**Subject Line C:** "[Company]: accessibility audit bottleneck?"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I've been auditing fintech compliance workflows, and I'm seeing the same pattern everywhere:

Ops teams spend **40% of their time** on manual accessibility audits instead of shipping features.

The bottleneck? Manual testing takes 20-40 hours per feature release.

I built an AI tool that automates WCAG audits:
- Scan in 2 minutes (not days)
- Prioritize violations by regulatory risk
- Generate compliance reports automatically

For payment processors like {{Company}}, this matters because:
→ Payment flows MUST be accessible (WCAG Level A minimum)
→ Manual audits block releases → AI catches violations before production

Does this resonate with what your team's dealing with right now?

Open to a 15-minute call if it does.

—{{YourName}}
```

**Follow-Up (Day 3):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick follow-up: I scanned {{Company}}'s checkout flow and found 12 critical accessibility issues.

Most common: Payment form labels missing → screen readers can't navigate.

Want the full audit? (Free, no strings attached.)

### 2. HEALTHTECH - HIPAA + ADA Compliance

**Subject Line A:** "Healthcare teams: accessibility + HIPAA"  
**Subject Line B:** "Patient portal accessibility = compliance gap"  
**Subject Line C:** "HIPAA + ADA = 2x compliance burden"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I've been looking at healthtech compliance workflows, and something stuck out:

Your compliance team has to track TWO things:
1. **HIPAA** (data privacy)
2. **ADA/WCAG** (accessibility)

Most teams treat these separately, which creates gaps.

Here's why it matters for {{Company}}:
→ Patient portals must be accessible (508 compliance)
→ Disabled patients can't book appointments → ADA lawsuit risk
→ Manual audits take 30+ hours → ops bottleneck

I built a tool that combines both:
- Scan for accessibility issues
- Verify HIPAA compliance on the same audit
- **Saves your compliance team 6+ hours per audit**

Worth a quick call?

—{{YourName}}
```

**Follow-Up (Day 3):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick stat: **73% of healthcare apps** fail basic accessibility tests.

{{Company}}'s patient portal included (I ran a quick scan).

Want to see the results? I can send you a free audit.

### 3. LEGALTECH - Law Firm Compliance

**Subject Line A:** "Law firms & accessibility: your biggest liability"  
**Subject Line B:** "Legal tech accessibility = avoiding malpractice"  
**Subject Line C:** "Clients can't use your tech = ADA lawsuit"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I've been looking at legal tech stacks, and found something ironic:

Most law firms use tools that **aren't accessible**.

This creates a problem:
→ Clients with disabilities can't use your tech
→ You (a legal firm) could be sued for ADA violations
→ Worse: you're supposed to be the compliance experts

For {{Company}}, this matters because:
→ Legal research tools must be screen-reader accessible
→ Document management systems = accessibility requirements
→ Client portals = ADA compliance mandatory

I built a tool that audits your tech stack for accessibility AND documents why it matters (good for internal arguments with IT).

Makes it easy to tell your CTO: "We need accessible tools."

### 4. BANKING - OCC Regulatory Scrutiny

**Subject Line A:** "OCC started auditing accessibility. Are you ready?"  
**Subject Line B:** "Banking accessibility = regulatory requirement"  
**Subject Line C:** "Neobanks: accessibility compliance matters"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick heads-up: **OCC started auditing accessibility** in 2024.

Banks that fail WCAG standards = regulatory action.

For {{Company}}, this creates urgency:
→ Mobile banking must be accessible (Section 508)
→ Account opening flows = WCAG Level AA minimum
→ Disabled customers = 15% of banking population

I built a tool that scans your banking app and generates compliance reports automatically.

**Saves ops teams 85% of audit time** (40 hours → 6 hours).

## TIER 2: MEDIUM URGENCY VERTICALS

### 5. SAAS PLATFORMS - B2B Compliance

**Subject Line A:** "Enterprise SaaS accessibility requirements"  
**Subject Line B:** "Your enterprise customers need WCAG certifications"  
**Subject Line C:** "SaaS accessibility = closing deals faster"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I've been talking to enterprise SaaS companies, and hearing the same story:

**Enterprise buyers require accessibility certifications** before signing contracts.

For {{Company}}, this matters because:
→ Fortune 500 customers = accessibility mandatory
→ No certification = no deal
→ Manual audits = 6-8 week delay

I built a tool that generates **WCAG compliance reports** automatically.

Most SaaS companies use it to:
1. Scan their product before enterprise demos
2. Generate certification docs for procurement teams
3. Track accessibility over time (monthly scans)

**Result:** Close deals 3x faster (no 6-week audit delay).

Worth a 15-min call?

### 6. GOVERNMENT - Section 508 Compliance

**Subject Line A:** "Government contractors: Section 508 mandatory"  
**Subject Line B:** "Federal contracts require accessibility compliance"  
**Subject Line C:** "508 compliance = winning government bids"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick question: Is {{Company}} bidding on federal contracts?

If yes, you need **Section 508 compliance** (accessibility standard for government contractors).

Here's the challenge:
→ Manual 508 audits take 40+ hours
→ Procurement teams reject non-compliant vendors
→ Competitors with certifications win bids

I built a tool that automates Section 508 audits:
- Scan in 2 minutes
- Generate compliance reports (formatted for procurement)
- Track fixes over time

**Result:** Get certified 10x faster, win more contracts.

### 7. MARKETPLACE - Two-Sided Platform Accessibility

**Subject Line A:** "Marketplace accessibility: buyers + sellers both matter"  
**Subject Line B:** "Two-sided platforms = 2x accessibility requirements"  
**Subject Line C:** "Accessible marketplaces = more conversions"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I've been looking at marketplace platforms, and found an interesting pattern:

**Two-sided platforms have 2x accessibility requirements**:
1. Buyer-side (search, checkout, reviews)
2. Seller-side (inventory management, analytics dashboard)

For {{Company}}, this matters because:
→ Disabled buyers can't purchase = lost revenue
→ Disabled sellers can't list products = fewer listings
→ Accessibility gaps = conversion drop-off

I built a tool that audits both sides:
- Buyer experience (search → checkout)
- Seller experience (dashboard → inventory)

**Typical result:** Find 15-20% more accessibility issues (missed in single-sided audits).

Want to see how it works?

### 8. HR TECH - Employee Accessibility

**Subject Line A:** "HR platforms: employee accessibility mandatory"  
**Subject Line B:** "Payroll + benefits must work for all employees"  
**Subject Line C:** "HR accessibility = avoiding discrimination claims"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick question: What % of your customers' employees have disabilities?

Answer: **15-20%** (vision, hearing, mobility, cognitive).

For HR platforms like {{Company}}, this creates risk:
→ Payroll systems must be accessible (ADA requirement)
→ Benefits enrollment = accessibility mandatory
→ Employee portals = discrimination lawsuits if inaccessible

I built a tool that audits HR platforms specifically:
- Scan payroll, benefits, time tracking
- Prioritize violations by employment law risk
- Generate compliance reports for HR teams

**Result:** Avoid discrimination claims, serve all employees.

### 9. TELECOM - Accessible Communications

**Subject Line A:** "Telecom accessibility = FCC requirement"  
**Subject Line B:** "Video calling + messaging must be accessible"  
**Subject Line C:** "Accessible telecom = serving disabled customers"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I've been looking at telecom accessibility requirements, and there's a critical gap:

**FCC requires accessible communications** (voice, video, messaging).

For {{Company}}, this matters because:
→ Video calling must support captions (deaf customers)
→ Messaging must work with screen readers (blind customers)
→ Customer portals = WCAG Level AA minimum

Manual audits take 30+ hours. I built a tool that automates this:
- Scan video calling UI
- Test screen reader compatibility
- Generate FCC compliance reports

**Result:** Stay compliant, avoid FCC fines.

Want to see how it works?

### 10. INSURANCE - Regulatory Defense

**Subject Line A:** "Insurance accessibility = state regulatory requirement"  
**Subject Line B:** "Policy portals must be accessible"  
**Subject Line C:** "Accessible insurance = avoiding lawsuits"

**Email Body (Template A):**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick stat: **Insurance companies face 2x more ADA lawsuits** than other industries.

Why? Policy portals aren't accessible.

For {{Company}}, this creates risk:
→ Policyholders can't access their accounts = lawsuit
→ Claims submission must be accessible = regulatory requirement
→ Mobile apps = WCAG Level AA minimum

I built a tool that audits insurance platforms:
- Scan policy portals, claims submission, mobile apps
- Prioritize by lawsuit risk
- Generate regulatory defense reports

**Result:** Avoid lawsuits, stay compliant.
