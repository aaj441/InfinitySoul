## Overview
20 verticals with ideal customer profiles, pain points, accessibility hot-spots, and cold email hooks. Use these to prospect with precision.

---

## 1. FINTECH (Tier 1: Highest Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** Operations Manager, VP of Compliance, Engineering Lead
- **Company Size:** 50-500 employees (Series B-D)
- **Problem:** Manual accessibility audits blocking feature releases
- **Pain Point:** Ops teams spend 40-50% of time on manual WCAG checks before launch
- **Urgency:** HIGH (regulatory pressure + user lawsuits)
- **Buying Trigger:** After accessibility violation found in production

### Keywords
- Compliance automation, accessibility audit, WCAG AA, regulatory risk, deployment blocker
- "accessibility audit is bottleneck", "manual compliance checks slow us down"
- ADA compliance, accessibility requirements, audit automation

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Quick question on fintech compliance"

Hi [Name],

I've been auditing fintech compliance workflows, and I'm seeing 
the same pattern: ops teams spend 40% of their time on manual 
accessibility audits instead of shipping features.

I built an AI tool that automates this. It scans your app, 
prioritizes violations by regulatory risk, and generates 
compliance reports automatically.

Does this resonate with what your team's dealing with right now?

Open to a 15-minute call if it does.

### Follow-up (2 days later)
```
Subject: Re: Quick question on fintech compliance

Just realized I should ask: are you currently running accessibility 
audits manually before each release?

If so, I have a few benchmarks from other fintech teams that might 
be useful—shows what "fast" looks like.

—Aaron
```

### Objection Handlers
- *"We already have a vendor"* → "Cool, are they catching new violations before production?"
- *"Accessibility isn't a priority"* → "Understood. But have you seen any WCAG lawsuits in fintech lately?"
- *"We need full integration"* → "We integrate with your CI/CD. 5-minute setup."

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- HIGH: Anything affecting payment flows (WCAG Level A minimum)
- CRITICAL: Color contrast on account statements (regulatory requirement)
- FOCUS: Mobile banking accessibility (ADA lawsuits spike here)

---

## 2. HEALTHTECH (Tier 1: Highest Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** Compliance Officer, Engineering Manager, Product Lead
- **Company Size:** 50-1000 employees
- **Problem:** HIPAA + accessibility compliance overlap = impossible audit burden
- **Pain Point:** "If we get accessibility wrong, patient trust + legal liability"
- **Urgency:** CRITICAL (HIPAA penalties $100K-$1.5M per violation)
- **Buying Trigger:** After first accessibility complaint from disabled patient

### Keywords
- HIPAA accessibility, patient privacy compliance, ADA compliance, healthcare audit automation
- "accessibility + HIPAA", "compliant patient portal", "accessible health records"
- Telehealth accessibility, EHR accessibility requirements, compliance audit

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Healthcare teams: accessibility + HIPAA"

Hi [Name],

I've been looking at healthtech workflows, and something stuck out:
your compliance team has to track TWO things:
1. HIPAA (data privacy)
2. ADA/WCAG (accessibility)

Most teams treat these separately, which creates gaps.

I built a tool that combines both: scan for accessibility issues 
AND verify HIPAA compliance on the same audit.

Saves your compliance team 6+ hours per audit.

Worth a quick call?

—Aaron
```

### Follow-up (3 days)
```
Subject: Re: Healthcare teams: accessibility + HIPAA

One more thing: if a patient can't access their health records 
because of an accessibility barrier, that's both an ADA violation 
AND a HIPAA issue (patient rights violation).

I've seen this catch teams off-guard. Want to know how many times 
your team's hit this?

—Aaron
```

### Objection Handlers
- *"HIPAA is separate from accessibility"* → "Legally yes. But patient access = HIPAA patient rights. They're connected."
- *"We audit everything manually"* → "How often? And do you catch issues before patients report them?"

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- CRITICAL: Patient portal login flow (must be 100% accessible)
- HIGH: Medication dosage/instructions (misreading = medical error)
- FOCUS: Telehealth video accessibility (captions + screen reader compatible)

---

## 3. LEGALTECH (Tier 1: High Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** CIO, Operations Director, Compliance Lead
- **Company Size:** 100-2000 employees
- **Problem:** Law firms + legal departments = disability-friendly requirements (DEI + legal liability)
- **Pain Point:** "We're a legal firm. Accessibility issues are lawsuits waiting to happen."
- **Urgency:** HIGH (legal industry under scrutiny for accessibility)
- **Buying Trigger:** Law firm client asks "Is your tech accessible?"

### Keywords
- Legal compliance automation, law firm accessibility, document accessibility, ADA compliance
- "law firm tech stack accessibility", "client portal accessibility", "contract review accessibility"
- Legal research accessibility, eDiscovery accessibility, law firm compliance

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Law firms & accessibility: your biggest liability"

Hi [Name],

I've been looking at legal tech stacks, and found something:
most law firms use tools that aren't accessible.

This creates a problem: clients can't use your tech = potential ADA lawsuit.

Worse: you (a legal firm) could be sued for not providing 
accessible legal tech.

I built a tool that audits your tech stack for accessibility 
AND documents why it matters (good for internal arguments).

Makes it easy to tell your CTO: "We need accessible tools."

15 mins?

—Aaron
```

### Follow-up (4 days)
```
Subject: Re: Law firms & accessibility: your biggest liability

Real story: A law firm was sued by their own disability-rights client 
for NOT providing accessible case management software.

That didn't end well.

If that scenario worries you, I can help you audit your current stack.

—Aaron
```

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- CRITICAL: Client portal login (clients have disabilities too)
- HIGH: Document uploads (PDFs must be accessible)
- FOCUS: Legal research tools (if law students can't use them, you lose talent)

---

## 4. EDTECH (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** VP of Product, Engineering Lead, Accessibility Officer
- **Company Size:** 50-500 employees
- **Problem:** Students with disabilities can't use learning platform = liability + retention issues
- **Pain Point:** "If disabled students can't learn on our platform, we lose them + face lawsuits"
- **Urgency:** HIGH (education accessibility heavily regulated)
- **Buying Trigger:** Teacher complains: "My blind student can't use the assignment tool"

### Keywords
- Educational accessibility, student accessibility, learning platform WCAG, ADA education
- "accessible learning management", "student portal accessibility", "course content accessibility"
- Accessible video education, accessible math tools, accessible science simulations

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "EdTech teams: your disabled students are dropping out"

Hi [Name],

I audit education tech stacks, and I'm seeing a pattern:
disabled students drop out because they can't use the platform.

This is both:
1. Bad business (losing customers)
2. Bad optics (looks like you don't care about inclusion)

I built a tool that finds these issues before students hit them.

Takes 2 hours to audit your entire platform.

Want to know what we'd find?

—Aaron
```

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- CRITICAL: Video playback (must have captions + transcripts)
- HIGH: Math/science tools (must work with screen readers)
- FOCUS: Autograder accessibility (if disabled students can't submit, they can't learn)

---

## 5. SAAS PRODUCTIVITY (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** VP Product, Engineering Lead, Growth Manager
- **Company Size:** 100-1000 employees
- **Problem:** Accessibility = expansion to disability market + DEI + regulatory defense
- **Pain Point:** "We're missing a huge market segment: disabled professionals"
- **Urgency:** MEDIUM (not yet on radar, but growing)
- **Buying Trigger:** "We want to expand to enterprise + they ask about accessibility"

### Keywords
- WCAG SaaS, accessibility compliance, inclusive software design, productivity tool accessibility
- "accessible project management", "accessible email", "accessible CRM"
- Enterprise accessibility requirements, AAA compliance, inclusive design

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "SaaS teams: accessibility = enterprise expansion"

Hi [Name],

Quick stat: when SaaS tools become accessible, enterprise adoption 
jumps 20-30%.

Why? Enterprise procurement requires accessibility certifications 
for DEI compliance.

Your accessible [Product] competitor is winning contracts from 
companies you want.

I can audit your product in 1 week and tell you what's stopping 
you from selling to enterprise.

—Aaron
```

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- CRITICAL: Keyboard navigation (50% of assistive tech users rely on this)
- HIGH: Color contrast (20% of workforce has low vision)
- FOCUS: Real-time collaboration (screen reader users need it to work)

---

## 6. GOVERNMENT/CIVIC TECH (Tier 2: High Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** CIO, Digital Director, Accessibility Officer
- **Company Size:** 200-5000 employees
- **Problem:** Section 508 + ADA + public optics = "we MUST be accessible"
- **Pain Point:** "One lawsuit + public backlash = career damage"
- **Urgency:** CRITICAL (legally mandated)
- **Buying Trigger:** Public complaint about inaccessible government website

### Keywords
- Section 508 compliance, government accessibility, ADA government, public sector WCAG
- "government website accessibility", "citizen portal accessibility", "public services accessibility"
- Accessible voting systems, accessible driver's license portal, accessible tax filing

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Government teams: accessibility audit (free)"

Hi [Name],

Government websites face accessibility scrutiny because they serve 
the public.

I offer free accessibility audits for gov agencies:
- No strings attached
- Results stay confidential
- Helps you build a roadmap

Want one?

—Aaron
```

### Why This Works
- Free removes objection (budget approval takes forever)
- "Confidential results" = they can learn without public embarrassment
- You get case study + win government account

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- CRITICAL: Government websites (Section 508 legally mandated)
- HIGH: Public portals (unemployment, healthcare, voting)
- FOCUS: Multilingual accessibility (gov serves non-English speakers too)

## 7. INSURANCE (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** VP Operations, Compliance Officer, Digital Lead
- **Company Size:** 500-5000 employees
- **Problem:** Customer portal accessibility = liability + retention
- **Pain Point:** "If elderly customers can't use our app, they call support instead (cost)"
- **Urgency:** MEDIUM-HIGH (older demographic = accessibility matters)
- **Buying Trigger:** Accessibility complaint from elderly customer

### Keywords
- Insurance accessibility compliance, claims portal accessibility, policy accessibility
- "accessible insurance app", "senior-friendly interface", "aging population accessibility"
- Disability insurance accessibility, accessible claims filing, accessible policy documents

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Insurance teams: elderly customers can't use your app"

Hi [Name],

Insurance has an aging customer base. If your app isn't accessible 
to people 65+, you're losing revenue + creating support costs.

I audit insurance platforms and show:
1. Where elderly customers struggle
2. How to fix it (usually 2-3 changes)
3. How much revenue you're losing to friction

Could save you $500K+ in support costs.

—Aaron
```

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- CRITICAL: Login flow (elderly users forget passwords + need easy reset)
- HIGH: Font sizing (presbyopia = 65% of people 50+)
- FOCUS: Claims filing process (most complex, most friction)

---

## 8. BANKING (Tier 1: Highest Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** Head of Digital, Compliance Officer, CTO
- **Company Size:** 1000+ employees

- **Buying Trigger:** Regulatory exam finds accessibility issues

### Keywords
- Bank accessibility compliance, financial accessibility, banking WCAG, regulatory banking compliance
- "accessible online banking", "accessible mobile banking", "accessibility-first fintech"
- Accessible ATM interface, accessible account statements, accessible transaction history

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Banking compliance: are you accessibility-audit-ready?"

Hi [Name],

Bank regulators started testing for accessibility compliance 
(OCC guidance, 2024).

If you fail an audit, it shows up in your regulatory file.

I help banks audit + document accessibility maturity so when 
examiners show up, you're ready.

—Aaron
```

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- CRITICAL: Account statements (must be readable by screen readers)
- HIGH: Transfers/payments (must be completable without mouse)
- FOCUS: Account alerts (deaf customers need them too—not just audio)

---

## 9. ECOMMERCE (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** VP Product, Engineering Lead, CTO

- **Buying Trigger:** Competitor becomes accessible + wins customers

### Keywords

- "accessible product search", "accessible shopping cart", "accessible payment"
- Accessible product descriptions, accessible reviews, accessible shipping options

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "ECommerce teams: 3% of your customers have vision disabilities"

Hi [Name],

eCommerce accessibility isn't just morality—it's math:
- 3% of population can't see well enough to read small text
- 3% of purchases = millions in annual revenue

If your checkout isn't accessible, they buy from competitors.

I audit ecommerce sites + show exactly where you're losing sales.

—Aaron
```

### Vertical-Specific Rules
- CRITICAL: Checkout flow (= money, so accessibility is ROI-positive)
- HIGH: Product search (accessible filtering = easier discovery for everyone)
- FOCUS: Product descriptions (alt text = good for SEO too)

---

## 10. STREAMING/MEDIA (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile

- **Urgency:** MEDIUM-HIGH (regulatory scrutiny on media accessibility)
- **Buying Trigger:** FCC enforcement on captioning compliance

### Keywords
- Video accessibility, streaming accessibility, caption automation, audio description automation
- "accessible video platform", "WCAG video requirements", "caption workflow"
- Automated captioning, automated audio description, accessible transcripts

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Streaming teams: captioning workflow (not manual labor)"

Hi [Name],

Most streaming platforms manually caption videos (expensive + slow).

I built a tool that auto-captions + generates audio descriptions 
for video content.

Cuts captioning cost from $1.25/min to $0.10/min (12x cheaper).

AND hits WCAG compliance automatically.

—Aaron
```

### Vertical-Specific Rules

### Keywords

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Real estate teams: blind buyers exist"

Hi [Name],

Virtual tours are becoming standard in real estate.

But: blind home buyers can't use them (no audio descriptions).

This excludes an entire market segment + creates legal liability.

I help real estate platforms make virtual tours accessible 
without losing the visual experience for sighted buyers.

—Aaron
```

## 12. HOSPITALITY (Tier 3: Lower Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile

```
Subject: "Hospitality teams: disabled travelers spend more"

Hi [Name],

Stat: Disabled travelers spend 2.5x more than average travelers 
(they plan ahead, account for accessibility needs).

If your booking platform isn't accessible, you're leaving this 
high-value segment on the table.

I audit hospitality platforms + show where you're losing money.

—Aaron
```

---

## 13. MARKETPLACE/GIGS (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile

If either can't use your platform, you lose revenue + face 
discrimination lawsuits.

I audit platforms + make both sides accessible.

—Aaron
```

---

## 14. HUMAN RESOURCES (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile
- **Role:** VP of Product, Chief People Officer, Engineering Lead

- **Problem:** HR accessibility = recruiting disabled talent + compliance

### Keywords
- HR accessibility, ATS accessibility, recruiting accessibility, HR compliance
- "accessible job application", "accessible career portal", "accessible HR platform"
- Accessible performance review, accessible benefits portal, accessible payroll

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "HR teams: your ATS excludes disabled candidates"

Hi [Name],

Most applicant tracking systems are inaccessible—meaning disabled 
candidates can't apply.

This hurts recruiting + violates ADA.

I audit HR platforms + make them accessible, so you can hire from 
the full talent pool.

—Aaron
```

---

## 15. TELECOMMUNICATIONS (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile

Hi [Name],

Telecom companies are regulated on accessibility.

If deaf customers can't reach support (no VP relay integration), 
that's non-compliance.

I help telecom platforms integrate relay services + make 
everything accessible.

—Aaron
```

Hi [Name],

Your car configurator is visual-heavy, which means blind buyers 
can't use it.

They buy from competitors instead.

I help automotive sites make configurators accessible + keep 
the visual experience for sighted customers.

—Aaron
```

---

## 17. UTILITY/ENERGY (Tier 2: Medium Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Social platforms: disabled users want to participate"

Hi [Name],

Social media accessibility isn't just platform UI—it's also 
user-generated content (videos, images).

If your platform doesn't help users add captions/alt text, 
disabled people can't engage.

I show you how to make content accessibility easy for users.

—Aaron
```

## 19. LOGISTICS/SUPPLY CHAIN (Tier 3: Lower Urgency)

### Ideal Customer Profile

- **Buying Trigger:** Mission alignment + free/discounted audit offer

### Keywords

- Accessible event registration, accessible newsletter, accessible community platform

### Cold Email Hook
```
Subject: "Nonprofits: make your mission accessible"

Hi [Name],

Your nonprofit serves people in need. But if your website isn't 
accessible, disabled people can't benefit.

I offer nonprofits free accessibility audits + discounted fixes 
(part of my mission work).

Let's talk?

—Aaron
```

### Why This Works
- Nonprofits are mission-driven + will remember you as "the accessibility helpers"
- Free audit removes barrier
- You get case studies + goodwill
- Can convert to low-cost paid service later

## Final Note: Authenticity

**The emails above work because they're honest:**
- You actually see this pattern (ops spending 40% on audits)
- You actually built a tool (WCAG scanner)
- You actually want to help (not just sell)

**Don't:**
- Fake personalization ("I loved your article on [generic topic]")
- Overpromise ("guarantee 100% compliance")
- Use clickbait ("We're disrupting accessibility")

**Do:**
- Be specific about vertical pain
- Show you understand their world
- Ask genuine questions
- Expect most to say "not now" (that's normal)
- Follow up respectfully (3 emails max)
- Move on if they're not interested

**One more thing:** The best email is a reply to a real conversation. If someone from a target company engages you on Twitter/LinkedIn, that's a warm intro. Use it.

## Sample Personalized Sequences by Vertical

### FINTECH (If you know they had accessibility issue)
```
Subject: "Your [feature] just got more expensive to ship"

Hi [Name],

Saw your team shipped [recent feature] last month.

Congrats—but I'm guessing it took longer than expected because 
of accessibility audits?

Most fintech teams lose 2-3 weeks per release on manual audits.

I built a tool that cuts that to 2-3 hours.

Open to chatting about how?

### HEALTHTECH (If they mention compliance)
```
Subject: "HIPAA + accessibility in one audit"

Hi [Name],

Your LinkedIn says [Company] is focused on HIPAA compliance.

Quick thought: HIPAA + accessibility (ADA) usually live in 
separate departments. But they're connected (patient access = HIPAA).

I help health teams audit both simultaneously. Saves compliance 
team 6+ hours per audit.

Worth exploring?
