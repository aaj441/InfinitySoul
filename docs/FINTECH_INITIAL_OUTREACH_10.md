## Follow-Up Strategy

**Subject:** "Quick follow-up: [Company] accessibility audit"  
**Body:**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick follow-up: I scanned {{Company}}'s [payment flow/checkout/dashboard] and found [X] critical accessibility issues.

Most common: [Specific violation example from actual scan].

Want the full audit? (Free, no strings attached.)

—[Your Name]
```

### Day 7 (No Reply)
**Subject:** "Last try: {{Company}} accessibility"  
**Body:**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short:

If accessibility audits are blocking your releases (like they do for 73% of fintech ops teams), I built a tool that automates WCAG scans in 2 minutes.

Worth 15 minutes to see a demo?

## Email Template (Fintech)

**Subject:** "Quick question on {{Company}} compliance workflow"

**Body:**
```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I've been auditing fintech compliance workflows, and I'm seeing the same pattern everywhere:

Ops teams spend **40% of their time** on manual accessibility audits instead of shipping features.

The bottleneck? Manual testing takes 20-40 hours per feature release.

I built an AI tool that automates WCAG audits:
- Scan in 2 minutes (not days)
- Prioritize violations by regulatory risk
- Generate compliance reports automatically

For {{CompanyType}} like {{Company}}, this matters because:
→ {{SpecificComplianceRequirement}}
→ Manual audits block releases → AI catches violations before production

Does this resonate with what your team's dealing with right now?

Open to a 15-minute call if it does.
